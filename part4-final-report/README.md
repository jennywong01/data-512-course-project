# Part 4: Final Report
The first part of this analysis focuses on an in-depth examination of the wildfires around Cedar City, Utah, utilizing data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) presented in both ArcGIS and GeoJSON formats. I will also develop the smoke estimate and compare it with the AQI data obtained from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
Then I will examine the potential impact of wildfire smoke on the economic development and public health of Cedar City, Utah. More specifically, I will focus on the aspect of crime, as it provides insights into its social impact while informing public health and economic policies. The overall goal of this analysis is to help inform our city council and residents about the potential future impact of smoke on their communities.

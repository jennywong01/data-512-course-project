# Data 512 Course Project
This course project is about analyzing the impact of smoke from wildfires on cities in the western US. This project consists of 3 parts. More specific documentation can be found inside the folder of each part.
- Part 1: Common Analysis

  More and more frequently summers in the western US have been characterized by wildfires with smoke billowing across multiple western     states. There are many proposed causes for this: climate change, US Forestry policy, and growing awareness, just to name a few. Regardless of the cause, the impact of wildland fires is widespread. There is a growing body of work pointing to the negative impacts of smoke on health, tourism, property, and other aspects of society.

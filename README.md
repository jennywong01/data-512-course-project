# Data 512 Course Project
This course project is about analyzing the impact of smoke from wildfires on cities in the western US. This project consists of 4 parts. More specific documentation can be found inside the folder of each part. All the data used in this research and their corresponding description can be found in each folder.

- Part 1: Common Analysis

  More and more frequently summers in the western US have been characterized by wildfires with smoke billowing across multiple western     states. There are many proposed causes for this: climate change, US Forestry policy, and growing awareness, just to name a few. Regardless of the cause, the impact of wildland fires is widespread. There is a growing body of work pointing to the negative impacts of smoke on health, tourism, property, and other aspects of society.

- Part 2: Extension Plan

  The proposed analysis is designed to address the problems impacting our community by the effects of wildfire smoke on urban life. The impact focus that I want to focus on is economics. Specifically, I am going to revolve around the crime rate of the city. A study that examined the effect of air pollution exposure on crime in the US over eight years found a robust positive relationship between air pollution and violent crimes, specifically assaults.

- Part 3: Presentation

  The slides provide a high-level summary of the analysis performed on the potential impact of wildfire smoke on the economic development of Cedar City, Utah. All the analysis code can be found in this project repository.

- Part 4: Final Report

  The first part of this analysis focuses on an in-depth examination of the wildfires around Cedar City, Utah, utilizing data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) presented in both ArcGIS and GeoJSON formats. I will also develop the smoke estimate and compare it with the AQI data obtained from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

  Then I will examine the potential impact of wildfire smoke on the economic development and public health of Cedar City, Utah. More specifically, I will focus on the aspect of crime, as it provides insights into its social impact while informing public health and economic policies. The overall goal of this analysis is to help inform our city council and residents about the potential future impact of smoke on their communities.
